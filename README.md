## What?

RyBucks are the true currency of the future. If you have not been brought into Ryan's holy embrace, I encourage you to discover the [source of his prophecies](https://youtu.be/-mKs-LKWzbU).

This is a basic [BEP-20](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20) coin hosted on [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain)

| Contract | Chain    | Address                                    |

| RyBucks  | test-bsc | [0x1DE3173eE9218D08C63858E8a6edaDC18a736956](https://testnet.bscscan.com/token/0x1DE3173eE9218D08C63858E8a6edaDC18a736956) |
| RySale   | test-bsc | [0x44625DCAc5057Bc9c0851c3367041DB7dBeeB604](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x44625DCAc5057Bc9c0851c3367041DB7dBeeB604) |

## How do I get it?

Participate in the RySale! Simply transfer BNB to the RySale contract, and see that your account is credited with RyBucks! The exchange rate is based on `10,000,000 RyBucks == $12.49` which at the time of writing these contracts, `$12.49 == 0.00289624 ETH == 0.02160670 BNB`. This results in a single RyBuck being a bit tricky to work the math out for perfectly, so in the spirit of RysGiving, sending `0.02160670 BNB` will result in you receiving a little more than 10 million RyBucks.

## Disclaimer

In case this wasn't clear, this is a meme coin with little to no utility (at least until the Rypocalypse happens). It serves only as a joke. I've done some testing of the contracts and utilized as much as I could from [open zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), but they are not audited. They were made by me half drunk on a Friday night. It is perfectly possible they contain bugs and flaws. If you are actually entertained/dumb enough to purchase some RyBucks, do so with all of this in mind. It is certainly not an investment, at least not a good one. I did this partially as a learning experience, and partially as a joke.
